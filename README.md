# Voice-Assistant
This is a sample code for a Python voice assistant using the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries

This is a very basic example, but you can customize it to suit your needs by adding more commands and functionalities. Just make sure to familiarize yourself with the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries and their documentation.

To run the code, you need to save it as a Python file with a .py extension (e.g. voice_assistant.py). Then, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Once you're in the correct directory, you can run the Python file by typing python voice_assistant.py (or whatever you named your file) and pressing enter. The program should start running, and you can begin interacting with your voice assistant by speaking commands into your microphone.

Make sure that you have the necessary libraries installed before running the code. You can install them using pip, the Python package installer, by typing pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 into your command prompt or terminal window.
